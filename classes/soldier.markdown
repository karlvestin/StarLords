## Soldier

You left the army or your mercenary company and are now in Claudius' service. In combat, you rely on your trusty machine gun to lay down suppressive fire on the enemy. You are a controller, or ranged defender. In effect, the star soldier has the following special ability:

##### Suppressing Fire
**Type:** Class Feature  
**Action:** Triggered Action  
**Trigger:** You make an attack with the Autofire keyword  
**Effect:** Whenever you make an attack that has the keyword Autofire, you may create a zone of suppressing fire. If the target of the attack was an area, the zone is equal to the area, otherwise, the zone is an area 1 centered around the target square of the attack. If an enemy within the zone moves voluntarily or makes an attack that doesn't include the character, you may make a Stay Down attack against that enemy. The zone remains until the end of your next turn.  

##### Stay Down
**Type:** At Will  
**Action:** Opportunity Action  
**Trigger:** An enemy that you can see in your zone of suppressing fire moves voluntarily or makes an attack that does not include you  
**Target:** The triggering enemy  
**Keywords:** Weapon, Single fire  
**Attack:** Strength vs Will  
**Hit:** The target's action is interrupted, if it was a move, the move ends, if it was an attack, the attack roll takes a -2 penalty. After the action has concluded, the target falls prone.

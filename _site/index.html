<h2 id='premises'>Premises</h2>

<p>Star Lords is an action-packed Science Fantasy RPG based on the D&amp;D 4E rules set. To ease the implementation of a 4E rule set for SF, certain caveats will apply.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unless otherwise noted, the rules as written in 4E PHB and DMG apply</li>

<li>The largest exception to above is the character creation and progress, which is based on the 4E principles, but implemented differently in Star Lords</li>

<li>No monsters or equipment is carried over from D&amp;D, specifically, no magic items are included.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Star Lords universe is science fantasy in the image of Star Wars or Warhammer 40K. As in a fantasy world, different cultures are inspired by earthly equivalents, but no explicit connections are made to our world, it is set &#8220;a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away&#8221;.</p>

<p>In this universe, space is ruled by the Star Lords, sovereign rulers akin to kings, imposing their will over one or more star systems. The Star Lords are remnants from the Star Empire that fell many hundred years ago due to internal strife.</p>

<p>Each Star Lord rules from a core world and his influence wanes the farther from the core world you travel. Outside the civilized worlds lie the barbarian Wild Stars where tribes and star pirates roam. The reasons for civilized people to venture into the Wild Stars vary, from natural resources such as radium, gold, airwood and slaves to military expeditions to treasure hunting among the tribal courts or old imperial ruins.</p>

<p>The most valuable substance among the Star Lord worlds is radium. Radium fules the ships, the guns and other contraptions created by the Scientists. Scientists are like a crossbreed of researchers, engineers and priests. They are subdivided into different classes, Glowmasters use the pure force of the radium, Engineers create devices harnessing the power of the radium and</p>

<p>Politically and technically, the Star Lords universe shares element from different periods in our history. The post-imperial political landscape is most reminiscent of Europe in the Dark Ages or China during the age of the warlords. Mixed with this is the colonization of the 18th and 19 century with frontier worlds and tribal worlds and the tensions of pre-WWI Europe. Technological level among the Star Lords is even more mixed. Tribal warriors fight with stone clubs and bows while the most advanced Star Troopers use powered armor and handheld radium cannons. Typically, the core worlds are more or less on WWI - WWII era technology with the addition of radium-powered technology such as spaceships, space stations, powered armor and so on. The secrets of nuclear power, apart from that given by radium technology, were lost when the Star Imperium fell.</p>

<p>One significant difference between the universe of Star Lords and our world is the addition of psionic powers, known among people as The Influence. The Influence is inherently linked to the almost magical power of radium, though the connection is poorly understood, even by the Scientists. It seems like it manifests more frequently and powerfully in the barbarian tribes than among their more civilized counterparts on the core worlds where radium technology has taken it&#8217;s place.</p>

<p>The heroes of Star Lords start as troubleshooters for the merchant baron Claudius Clockmaker, a minor noble running a small merchant operation in the back streets of the city of Cinder, dealing with radium artifacts from the Wild Stars.</p>

<h2 id='character_creation'>Character Creation</h2>

<p>Character creation in the Star Lords universe is severly limited, to decrease the scope of the rules needed for gaming. To this end, characters will be created by the DM in cooperation with the players and character progression will be quite rigid. Also the character creation rules will initially only cover the first five levels of gameplay (roughly ten adventures). A few classes are provided, but only those actually selected are fleshed out enough for play. Furthermore, each class only has one power per level meaning that there is limited possibility to tweak the classes. Instead, each level the character receives one feat from a set of class-specific, race-specific or generic feats. These feats are all Star Lors specific, none are carried over from the D&amp;D 4E rules set.</p>

<h3 id='classes'>Classes</h3>

<h4 id='freepilot'>Freepilot</h4>

<p>The Glowships are the radium fueled starships that travel the interplanetary and interstellar space. Some of these ships are part of merchant houses, navies and the like, but many sail under independent flag, commandeered by freepilots, a rowdy bunch of freedom-loving individualists. As a freepilot, you don&#8217;t start the game with any ship of your own, instead you pilot Claudius&#8217; old ship The Red Rooster. In combat, you rely on wits and subterfuge.</p>

<h4 id='star_soldier'>Star Soldier</h4>

<p>You left the army or your mercenary company and are now in Claudius&#8217; service. In combat, you rely on your trusty machine gun to lay down suppressive fire on the enemy. In effect, the star soldier has the following special ability</p>

<h5 id='suppressing_fire'>Suppressing Fire</h5>

<p><strong>Type:</strong> At-will<br /><strong>Action:</strong> Minor Action<br /><strong>Keywords</strong>: Weapon, Autofire<br /><strong>Effect:</strong> Create an Area 1 Zone of Suppressing Fire within the weapon&#8217;s range. If an enemy in the zone that the character can see, moves or makes an attack that does not include the character, the character may choose to either make an ordinary opportunity attack or make a Stay Down attack (which is an Immediate Interrupt, only one may be made by the character per round)</p>

<h5 id='stay_down'>Stay Down</h5>

<p><strong>Type:</strong> Immediate Interrupt<br /><strong>Trigger:</strong> An enemy that you can see in your Zone of Suppressing Fire moves voluntarily or makes an attack that does not include you and you chose not to make an attack of opportunity<br /><strong>Keywords:</strong> Weapon, Autofire<br /><strong>Attack:</strong> Strength vs Will<br /><strong>Hit:</strong> The target&#8217;s action is interrupted, if it was a move, it stays in the square where it was hit, if it was an attack, the attack is cancelled. The action is spent and the target falls prone.</p>

<p>You have seen battle numerous times, at the Battle of the Starfish Nebula or on the deadly sand fields of Doruk. You&#8217;ve had men die under your command and you&#8217;ve saved and taken lives numerous times. Now you are a bit tired of it all and you&#8217;ve accepted an offer from Sir Clockmaker for a more quiet and sober life. In combat you fight through others</p>
